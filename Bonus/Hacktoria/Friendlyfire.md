Greetings, Special Agent K.

Our friends over at the South Africa National Defense Force have reached out for help. Recently, one of their patrols in the north of their country, came under fire from an armored vehicle. At first they thought this to be friendly fire, however no other units were in the area.

They sent a drone to inspect the vehicle and managed to take a photo, before being forced to retreat. Six out of the twenty-four strong platoon were injured, all survived after being evacuated by helicopter.

As they are unfamiliar with the model of the tank, which has since vanished. Therefor they call for our help in identifying the vehicle. That is where you come in, identify the tank so we can track the origins and maybe get further in this investigation.

As always, Special Agent K. The Contract is yours, if you choose to accept.
