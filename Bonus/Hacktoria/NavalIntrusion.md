Greetings, Special Agent K.

We have a special case on our hands today. As tensions around the island nation of Taiwan rise by the day, allied nations reach out frequently for our help. Today is no exception.

This morning at 09:43 Taipei Standard Time, the Taiwanese Navy identified a foreign vessel entering itâ€™s waters. Upon making contact, the ship left westward for international waters. However, a UAV was dispatched and managed to snatch a picture of the vessel.

The ship did not identify, nor does it match the database of known vessels operated by any Navy around the world. It comes close to several, but appears to be altered for a different purpose.

The Taiwanese government signed a contract for our services to identify the original make and model of the vessel.

As always, Special Agent K. The Contract is yours, if you choose to accept.
