Greetings, Special Agent. 

It has come to our attention that one of our subsidiaries, crucial for reconnaissance operations, has fallen victim to a ransomware attack. This incident has disrupted our ongoing mission in the Riviera region. Although the impact on our overall operations is minimal, we require your expertise to investigate this breach and ensure the security of our digital infrastructure. 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to conduct a thorough investigation into the ransomware attack. You will need to identify the threat actor behind this attack, assess the extent of the damage, and determine how much sensitive data has been compromised. It is imperative that you trace the origin of the attack but also maintain Operational Security as you may become a target yourself. 

To aid in your investigation, you will be provided with minimal details regarding the cyber attack. Our Hacker Dimitri will be available to assist you as needed. Once you have gathered sufficient information and have a clear understanding of the situation, you are to provide a detailed report of your findings back to SERPENT HQ. Time is of the essence in this matter, as we cannot afford any further disruptions to our operations. We have complete faith in your abilities to handle this situation with the utmost professionalism and discretion. 

As always, the contract is yours, if you choose to accept.
