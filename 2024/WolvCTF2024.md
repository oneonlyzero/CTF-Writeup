**Category : OSINT**

**1. WOLPHV I: Reconnaissance**

- Searching for "Wolphv Ransomware Group" on search engine will lead you to the the `X` post from the account `FalconFeeds.io`. [Here](https://twitter.com/FalconFeedsio/status/1706989111414849989)
- Take a look to all of the reply/comment inside the post you will notice the account with the username `Joe Osint` which seem to look like he commenting some `base64` text. [Here](https://twitter.com/JoeOsint__)
- Take the `base64` and decode it. you will successfully obtained the flag :).

**2. WOLPHV II: Infiltrate**

- Try to find others social media related to the `Wolvph` group beside their official `X` account and find one account related to them on `Facebook`. [Here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/921721029413388/?hoisted_section_header_type=recently_seen&multi_permalinks=921722342746590)
- In the `Facebook` account, you will find a video post, seem normal in the beginning, but at the end of the video, you can see all of the search tab on the top of browser right after the person close the slide.
- Looking at the search tab, you find a few searching for example `Funny cat`, `How to hack`, etc. but the one that caught my eye is the discord search : `discord.com/UbeJPeBT`.
- At first, if you directly just copied 100% like in the search, you go to the discord `unable to find channel page`.
- Just change the `.com` of the link to `.gg` and you will be directed to a discord channel `Wolpvh`
- Look at the top at the `General` chat and you will obtained the flag.

**3. WOLPHV III: p1nesh4dow48**

- You will get an image of an apartment between the conversation.
- First, i enchance the image using `Ai image Enhancer` to make the imaage more cleaer.
- Then try to look any particular on the image that will help to make the searching scope became smaller.
- We obtained a few information in the image such as : The parking lot sign `Pine Ridge Visitor Parking`, The car driver on the left side (probally USA), And the apartment.
- Using a few osint tool `(google image, google maps, search engine)  and information gathered)`
- You will find the location of the apartment which is `Pine Ridge Apartment` or `Marquette's Affordable Housing` located at  `Marquette Michigan`
- The flag, required you to find the exact long,lang of the image location and wrap it in the flag format : `wctf{xxxx,xxxx}`

**4. WOLPHV IV: d4wgbyte262**

- Inside the discord conversation, the user `d4wgbyte262` mentioned about his dog, and a little bit information of his house location `i live the closest to a fire station out of all my friends who are neighbors they dont understand my pain - d4wgbyte262 `
